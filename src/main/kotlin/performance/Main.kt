/*
* Coroutines are less resource-intensive than JVM threads.
* Code that exhausts the JVM's available memory when using
* threads can be expressed using coroutines without hitting
* resource limits. For example, the following code launches
* 50,000 distinct coroutines that each waits 5 seconds and
* then prints a period ('.') while consuming very little memory

/*
* If you write the same program using threads (remove runBlocking,
* replace launch with thread, and replace delay with Thread.sleep),
*  it will consume a lot of memory. Depending on your operating
* system, JDK version, and its settings, it will either throw an
* out-of-memory error or start threads slowly so that there are
* never too many concurrently running threads.
